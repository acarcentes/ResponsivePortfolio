Responsive Portfolio

My name is Abraham Carcentes, and this is the first responsive website I design, in this first design Bootstrap was
used in conjunction with CSS styling for a better appearance, this was a very challenging task since my knowledge
is still very limited, soon I will make a better use of semantic HTML and CSS.

I'm trying to make this website in a informal aproach but using all the tools that at this moment (limited by my knowledge) I'm able to use.
